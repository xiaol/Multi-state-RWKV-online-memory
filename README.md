# Multi-State RWKV Online Memory

Mechanism-level experiments for comparing Dynamic Linear Attention (DLA) with
RWKV-style online memory under controlled state and boundary policies.

This repository starts from the Log-Linear Attention codebase and adds a
CPU-only proof of concept in `dla_poc.py`. It reproduces the core DLA mechanism
from arXiv 2606.10650 and adds HRM-Text-inspired memory baselines:

- `rwkv_mem(delta_rule)`: single online delta-rule associative memory.
- `rwkv_mem(rwkv7)`: single read-before-write RWKV-7 state.
- `rwkv_mem(rwkv7 multi-state)`: same RWKV-7 state update, but one state per
  adaptive memory block.
- State-only ablation: fixes the exact same boundaries for linear/DLA states
  and RWKV-7 states, so the comparison isolates the state update.

## Quick Start

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" bash run.sh
```

If the environment is already set up:

```bash
.venv/bin/python dla_poc.py
```

Outputs are written to:

```

## Current Result

The main DLA reproduction still passes:

- DLA lowers the Theorem 3.1 deviation bound in every tested config.
- DLA beats fixed Log-Linear blocking on needle recall at matched state count.
- The repo Log-Linear attention smoke test passes on CPU.

Mechanism recall comparison:

| needles | filler/seg | K | states | fixed | rwkv_mem(delta_rule) | rwkv_mem(rwkv7) | rwkv_mem(rwkv7 multi-state) | DLA |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 6 | 8 | 16 | 12.0 | 0.920 | 0.229 | 0.797 | 1.000 | 1.000 |
| 10 | 6 | 24 | 20.0 | 0.934 | 0.122 | 0.682 | 1.000 | 1.000 |
| 8 | 10 | 20 | 16.0 | 0.887 | 0.046 | 0.626 | 1.000 | 1.000 |

State-update-only result, with identical boundaries for both states:

```text
RWKV-7 state wins: 11
linear/DLA state wins: 0
ties: 4
```

Interpretation:

- With perfect or near-perfect boundaries, linear/DLA state and RWKV-7 state tie
  on this synthetic recall task.
- When boundaries are fixed, noisy, or compressed to low K, RWKV-7 state is more
  robust in this task.
- DLA's main advantage is adaptive boundary/state allocation; RWKV-7's advantage
  appears in the state update when boundaries are held fixed and imperfect.

Full tables are in `EVAL.md`.

## What Is Compared

`dla_poc.py` runs four groups of checks.

1. Codebase smoke test
   - Loads the original Log-Linear Attention pure PyTorch path directly.
   - Avoids CUDA-only Triton/Mamba dependencies.

2. DLA deviation-bound check
   - Implements Algorithm 1: information-aware dynamic state merging.
   - Implements Algorithm 2: capacity-bounded adjacent state merging.
   - Compares DLA blocks against fixed contiguous blocks at matched state count.

3. Needle associative recall
   - Uses synthetic rare needle tokens mixed with redundant filler tokens.
   - Compares fixed blocks, DLA blocks, delta-rule memory, RWKV-7 memory, and
     multi-state RWKV-7 memory.

4. State-update-only ablation
   - Uses the same block boundaries for both linear/DLA and RWKV-7 state update.
   - Boundary policies: `oracle`, `dla`, `fixed`, `noisy_dla`, `low_k_dla`.
   - This isolates whether the state update/readout is stronger, independent of
     boundary selection.

## Scope

This is a training-free mechanism reproduction. It does not reproduce 50B-token
pretraining, downstream language-model evaluations, or trained HRM-Text
checkpoints.

The HRM/RWKV baselines are self-contained ports of the memory recurrence ideas,
not full imports of HRM-Text:

- `rwkv_mem(delta_rule)` follows the read-before-write delta-rule associative
  state from HRM-Text's `models/rwkv_memory.py`.
- `rwkv_mem(rwkv7)` follows the latest read-before-write RWKV-7 recurrence from
  HRM-Text's `models/rwkv7.py`, specialized to the synthetic key/value stream.

## Acknowledgement

This work builds on the Log-Linear Attention repository and uses local
HRM-Text/RWKV memory ideas as mechanism baselines. The added experiments are
intended for controlled research exploration, not as a trained-model benchmark.
